Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Fortunatly yes, the three model architectures successfully classified the breed of dog
in Dog_01.jpg to be of German Shephard breed


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes they did, Dog_02.jpg image is the same image of Dog_01.jpg but it's flipped 180 degrees.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, they all classified them as not dogs.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: According to the accuracy, I see that the models did well in our short and plain dataset
        however, I see that VGG CNN model architecture is the best of which because it did it more
        faster than other models, and especially it works more accurate in the large dataset with 100%
        correct dogs, 100% correct not dogs, 93.333% correct breeds, 87.5% match labels.
